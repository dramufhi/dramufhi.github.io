            Hey there, I‚Äôm Dakalo. I turn coffee into code and wild ideas into
            digital delights. When I‚Äôm not debugging my life choices, I‚Äôm
            crafting clean, scalable solutions that make users say ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù
            instead of ‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶?‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            I build everything from static and dynamic websites using HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and GitHub Pages to mobile apps powered by React Native
            and Node.js magic. Along the way, I sprinkle in Google AdSense, AI
            video tricks, and custom automations, all while weaving storytelling
            into interfaces so your users stay glued to the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I debug life one line at a time (bugs tremble in fear), speak fluent
            JavaScript‚Äîand just enough sarcasm to keep things interesting‚Äîand
            treat deadlines as motivational suggestions rather than tyrannical
            masters. If you‚Äôve got a project that needs a pinch of creativity
            and a dash of humor, drop me a line. Let‚Äôs turn your vision into
            code (and maybe share a coffee along the way).
          </p>

          <p>
            These days I‚Äôm a Full Stack Engineer on Sage‚Äôs Distribution and
            Manufacturing Operations team, where I help bring Sage Intacct‚Äôs
            cloud finance manufacturing features to life. I whip up dynamic UIs
            in TypeScript and React, tame data with GraphQL, spin Node.js
            services into Docker containers, and shepherd deployments through
            GitHub. Working across time zones, I keep order-management workflows
            and real-time reporting dashboards humming along‚Äîfaster than a
            double-shot espresso cools down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Sage, I was a Systems Developer at FutureSoft in Centurion,
            enhancing Excalibur, their flagship debt-collection platform. I
            translated business requirements into clean C# services, sculpted
            responsive dashboards with JavaScript, Kendo UI, and Bootstrap, and
            tuned MS SQL queries until they ran smoother than a perfectly
            frothed cappuccino. From back-end batch processes to front-end user
            analytics, I partnered with product owners to ship features on
            schedule and to spec.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my Sitecore developer chapter at NML in Cape Town, we rebuilt the
            DirectAxis website on the latest CMS version and built ‚ÄúPulse,‚Äù a
            credit-score checking service powered by TransUnion and Sanlam APIs.
            I handled everything from ASP.NET MVC and C# on the server side to
            HTML, CSS, jQuery, and vanilla JavaScript on the client, then used
            MongoDB to model user behavior and deliver personalized content that
            keeps customers coming back for more.
          </p>
          <p>
            My earliest gigs sharpened my problem-solving grit: as an Academy
            Developer intern at NML, I dove into C#, MVC .NET, and JavaScript to
            support client projects; at AIMSSEC I built a C# WinForms timetable
            generator, maintained LANs/WANs, and taught IT fundamentals to
            future educators; and at the University of Venda I tutored
            foundation mathematics, helping students conquer algebraic puzzles
            with patience‚Äîand the occasional corny math joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            Across every role, I‚Äôve expanded my toolkit‚ÄîTypeScript, React,
            Node.js, C#, ASP.NET MVC, GraphQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB,
            Docker, Sitecore, Copilot, and more‚Äîand learned that reliable code,
            like reliable school lunches, keeps everyone happy. If you need a
            front-to-back solution or a custom integration that just works,
            let‚Äôs talk‚Äîespresso‚Äôs on me.

          <h2 class="major">About</h2>
          <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            Hey there! I‚Äôm a caffeine-fueled full stack engineer with over eight
            years of experience turning wild ideas into clean, scalable
            solutions. I graduated Cum Laude with a BSc in Computer Science and
            Mathematics, earned a Sitecore Professional Developer certification,
            and collected more academic awards than I have semicolons in my
            JavaScript files. When I‚Äôm not debating punctuation standards,
            you‚Äôll find me crafting cloud finance features at Sage or hunting
            down the perfect espresso shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            My toolkit spans the full stack: TypeScript, React, JavaScript,
            HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Kendo UI on the frontend; Node.js, C#,
            ASP.NET MVC, GraphQL, and REST APIs on the backend; and MS SQL,
            PostgreSQL, and MongoDB taming data. Docker and GitHub keep
            deployments smooth, while Sitecore, Copilot, and the Carbon design
            system help deliver polished, enterprise-grade experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Academically, I was honored as the top student in the School of
            Mathematical and Natural Sciences and earned Vice-Chancellor‚Äôs
            awards in 2013 and 2014. That same drive translated into
            professional achievements‚Äîshipping features that connect to
            TransUnion, Sanlam, and internal APIs, and architecting
            debt-collection modules that balance reliability with razor-sharp
            code quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I‚Äôm off the clock, I‚Äôm geeking out over sci-fi novels,
            experimenting with AI-generated videos, or plotting my next travel
            adventure (because nothing sparks fresh ideas like a new city!). I
            believe curiosity fuels innovation, and I bring that spark into
            every project.
          </p>
          <p>

            website, a React Native app, or an automation that saves you hours,
            I‚Äôm your sidekick‚Äîespresso in hand. Send me an
